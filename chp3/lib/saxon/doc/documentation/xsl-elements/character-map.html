      <h1>xsl:character-map</h1>
      
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The <code>xsl:character-map</code> declaration defines a named character map for use
         during serialization. The <code>name</code> attribute gives the name of the character map, which can be
         referenced from the <code>use-character-maps</code> attribute of <code>xsl:output</code>. The
         <code>xsl:character-map</code> element contains a set of <code>xsl:output-character</code> elements each
         of which defines the output representation of a given Unicode character. The character is specified using
         the <code>character</code> attribute, the string which is to replace this character on serialization is
         specified using the <code>string</code> attribute. Both attributes are mandatory.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The replacement string is output <i>as is</i>, even if it contains special (markup) characters. So, for
         example, you can define &lt;xsl:output-character character="&amp;#xa0;" string="&amp;nbsp;"/&gt; to ensure that
         NBSP characters are output using the entity reference <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Character maps allow you to produce output that is not well-formed XML, and they thus provide a replacement
         facility for <code>disable-output-escaping</code>. A useful technique is to use characters in the Unicode
         private use area (xE000 to xF8FF) as characters which, if present in the result tree, will be mapped to
         special strings on output. For example, if you want to generate a proprietary XML-like format that uses
         tags such as &lt;!IF&gt;, &lt;!THEN&gt;, and &lt;!ELSE&gt;, then you could map these to the three characters
         xE000, xE001, xE002 (which you could in turn define as entities so they can be written symbolically in your
         stylesheet or source document).
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Character maps are preferred to <code>disable-output-escaping</code> because they do not rely on an
         intimate interface between the transformation engine and the serializer, and they do not distort the data model. The
         special characters can happily be stored in a DOM, passed across the SAX interface, or manipulated in any
         other way, before finally being rendered by the serializer.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Character maps may be assembled from other character maps using the <code>use-character-maps</code>
         attribute. This contains a space-separated list of the names of other character maps that are to be
         included in this character map.
      </p>
      
      
      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Using character maps may be expensive at run-time. I have not measured the effect. Saxon currently makes no
         special attempts to optimize their use: if character maps are used, then every character that is output
         will be looked up in a hash table to see if there is a replacement string.
