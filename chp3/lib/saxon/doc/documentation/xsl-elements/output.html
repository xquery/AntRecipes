      <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The <code>xsl:output</code> element is used to control the format of serial output files resulting
         from the transformation. It is always a top-level element immediately below the<code>xsl:stylesheet</code> element.
         There may be multiple <code>xsl:output</code> elements; their values are accumulated as described in the
         XSLT specification.

               <p>This indicates the format or destination of the output. The value "xml" indicates
                  XML output (though if disable-output-escaping is used there is no guarantee that it is well-formed).
                  A value of "html" is used for HTML output. The value "text" indicates plain text output: in this case
                  no markup may be written to the file using constructs such as literal result elements, xsl:element,
                  xsl:attribute, or xsl:comment.
               </p>
               
               <p><i>The value "xhtml" is supported, however, the output of this method doesn't follow all the rules
                     defined in the XSLT 2.0 specification, for example, no META element is created in the output.</i></p> 
                
               
               <p>Alternatively output can be directed
                  to a user-defined
                  Java program by specifying the name of the class as the value of the method attribute, prefixed by
                  a namespace prefix, for example "xx:com.me.myjava.MyEmitter". The class must be
                  on the classpath, and must implement either the org.xml.sax.DocumentHandler interface, the
                  org.xml.sax.ContentHandler interface, or the
                  net.sf.saxon.output.Emitter interface. The last of these, though proprietary, is a richer interface that
                  gives access to additional information.

                  US-ASCII, iso-8859-1, utf-8, utf8, KOI8R, cp1251. It is used for three distinct purposes: to control character conversion
                  by the Java I/O routines; to determine which characters will be represented as character entities; and
                  to document the encoding in the output file itself. The default (and fallback) is utf-8.

               <p>as in the XSLT spec: values "yes" or "no" are accepted. The indentation
                  algorithm is different for HTML and XML. For HTML it avoids outputting extra space before or
                  after an inline element, but will indent text as well as tags, except in elements such as PRE
                  and SCRIPT. For XML, it avoids outputting extra whitespace except between two tags. The
                  emphasis is on conformance rather than aesthetics!

                  the value assigned is passed back to the calling application in the OutputDetails object, where
                  is can be accessed using the getMediaType() method. The supplied servlet application SaxonServlet
                  uses this to set the media type in the HTTP header.
